    Challanges Faced:  Where do I begin.  This challenge was an epic failure.  When I was given the mock up but nothing else, I realized that I am quite limited in what I have retained over the last two weeks.  I was able to get the HTML framework built.  Unfortunatly, I don't have a clear enough understanding of the CSS concepts to position things where I wanted them so I was never truely able to style them into something coherent.

    Successes:  I was able to put together a rough HTML layout.  I feel I did a decent job with the header and was able to add some advanced styling to it.
